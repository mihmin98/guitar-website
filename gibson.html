                Gibson sells guitars under a variety of brand names and builds one of the world's most iconic guitars, the Gibson Les Paul. 
                Gibson was at the forefront of innovation in acoustic guitars, especially in the big band era of the 1930s; the Gibson Super 400 was widely imitated. 
                In 1952, Gibson introduced its first solid-body electric guitar, the Les Paul, which became its most popular guitar to date.
