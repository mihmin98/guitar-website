            <h3>GENERAL INFO</h3>
            <p>
                The Fender Stratocaster is a model of electric guitar designed from 1952 into 1954 by Leo Fender, Bill Carson, George Fullerton, and completed by Freddie Tavares. 
                The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation has continuously manufactured the Stratocaster from 1954 to the present. 
                It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top "horn" shape for balance like the Precision Bass guitar. 
                Along with the Gibson Les Paul and Fender Telecaster, it is one of the most-often emulated electric guitar shapes. 
                "Stratocaster" and "Strat" are trademark terms belonging to Fender. 
                Guitars that duplicate the Stratocaster by other manufacturers are usually called S-Type or ST-type guitars.
