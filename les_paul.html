                The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by the Gibson Guitar Corporation in 1952. 
                The Les Paul was designed by Gibson president Ted McCarty, factory manager John Huis and their team, with some input from, and endorsement by, guitarist Les Paul. 
                Its typical design features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top and a single cutaway, a mahogany set-in neck with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and tone controls, and a stoptail bridge, although variants exist.

                The sunburst 1958–1960 Les Paul – today one of the best-known electric guitar types in the world – was considered a failure, with low production and sales.
                For 1961, the Les Paul was redesigned into what is now known as the Gibson SG. 
                The original single-cutaway, carved top bodystyle was re-introduced in 1968. 
                The Les Paul has been produced in many versions and editions since. 
                Along with Fender's <a href="telecaster.html">Telecaster</a> and <a href="stratocaster.html">Stratocaster</a>, it was one of the first mass-produced electric solid-body guitars. 
                Due to their versatility, Les Paul electric guitars have been used in a wide range of music genres, including rock, country, pop, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, reggae, punk, and heavy metal.
