                    The Fender Telecaster, colloquially known as the "Tele", is the world's first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar. 
                    Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke ground and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music. 
                    Introduced for national distribution as the Broadcaster in the autumn of 1950, it was the first guitar of its kind manufactured on a substantial scale and has been in continuous production in one form or another since its first incarnation.

                    Just like the <a href="stratocaster.html" hreflang="en">Fender Stratocaster</a>, the Telecaster is also a versatile guitar, usable for most styles of music and has been used in many genres, including country, reggae, rock, pop, folk, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, punk, and heavy metal.
