                Superstrat is a name for an electric guitar design that resembles a Fender <a href="stratocaster.html">Stratocaster</a> but with differences that clearly distinguish it from a standard Stratocaster, usually to cater to a different playing style. 
                Differences typically include more pointed, aggressive-looking body and neck shapes, different woods, increased cutaways (resulting in deeper horns) to facilitate access to the higher fret, increased number of frets, contoured heel facilitating easier higher fret access, usage of humbucking pickups and locking tremolo systems, most commonly the Floyd Rose.

                There is no formal definition of a superstrat; the categorisation is still largely left to popular opinion and depends greatly on the artist(s) associated with a particular model and how it is marketed.
